# Anagram-Equations

`Eleven plus two is an anagram of twelve plus one.`

Can you find more examples? To be specific, we are looking for valid equations that when spelled out are anagrams. You may assume some fast method of converting a number into its spelling. Inversions (a + b = b + a) are not allowed.

## Numbergrams 
Candidate solutions can be grouped into two classes. Those where both sides of the equation use the same digits (numbergrams) and everything else. The example above is a numbergram. Do there exist any solutions that are not numbergrams? Can we prove that there are none?

## Aditional Challenges
* Are there examples using other operations (minus, times, etc.)
* Are there examples in other languages?
